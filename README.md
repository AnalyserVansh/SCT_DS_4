In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of accident data to identify key factors contributing to road accidents and generate actionable insights. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib), I cleaned, processed, and visualized the data to uncover patterns related to accident frequency, severity, and causes.
